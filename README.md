# Morris.js AJAX Demo

This is a super simple demo of loading JSON data asynchronously for a Morris.js
chart.

Note: if you want to try the demo, upload the code to a web host, or use a
development webserver like Python's SimpleHTTPServer (which will make the code
available at http://localhost:8000/).

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
